SELECT
  DISTINCT [ON]
    (first_filter; for not aggregate) WHERE [=,>,<,>=,<=,!=,AND,OR]
      ORDER BY [columns default:ASC/DESC; without: order as inserted into the table]
        LIMIT OFFSET
  [NOT] BETWEEN (included)/IN [(v1,v2,)/subquery] /LIKE [ILIKE; case insensivity] 'pattern%_'
  GROUP BY; divides the rows returned from the SELECT statement into >groups<. For each group: aggregate function
    good practice: select column by which grouping
      (second_filter: on agregate) HAVING; filter group
  JOIN
    [INNER] JOIN
    LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
